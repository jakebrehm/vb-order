A script meant to help automate our weekly lunch order at a restaurant named *Village Burger*.

# What does it do?

Previously, those that wanted to go would enter their order into a shared spreadsheet (shown below), and someone would call in the order so that it can be ready by the time we get to the restaurant. However, the person that is calling in the order would have to manually divide the orders by payment type, cook, etc., which can be slightly annoying when you don't have much time that day. A pivot table can mostly accomplish this, except it is unable to show the notes that someone may have added to his/her order.

Because of this, I decided to write a script that would do this automatically and then email a summary of all of the orders (including notes) to whoever's going to call it in that week. An example of the summary email is shown below.

It's a simple script, but it just showcases how useful programming languages can be.
